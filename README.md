# forecast-lake-george
Setting up a workflow to generate automated near-term forecasts of weather, water quality, and the food web of Lake George NY

Currently everything is designed to be run from `make_report.R` which sets up the initial temperature profile based on Lake George vertical profiler data (if connected to the database) or based on the mean for that day from simulations of 2015-2019 (not currently included here). It then sources files to (1) get NOAA GEFS data to drive the models and run LakeEnsemblr models for each GEFS ensemble member, (2) run GLM with AED for each GEFS ensemble member (note I do not have a good setup to get initial conditions for this), and (3) run the Allometric Trophic Network food web model for Lake George using the ensemble mean condition and variable food web parameterizations. After running these scripts, the data are compiled into a pdf report by rendering `forecast_report.Rmd` and can then be automatically emailed out to interested parties (currently just me, and this requires some additional setup to use `emayili`).
